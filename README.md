# UFOs

## Overview

This project involved setting up a website for an UFO afficionado named Dana. She provided us with a table of UFO sighting data including the date, city, state, country, and shape of the craft. Our challenge was to make a site that displayed the data as an HTML table and filtered according to user input. The filtering process was powered by Javascript.

## Results

The website works well enough. To perform a search, the user must enter the filter criteria in the provided input fields, highlighted below:
