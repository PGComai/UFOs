# UFOs

## Overview

This project involved setting up a website for an UFO afficionado named Dana. She provided us with a table of UFO sighting data including the date, city, state, country, and shape of the craft. Our challenge was to make a site that displayed the data as an HTML table and filtered according to user input. The filtering process was powered by Javascript.

## Results

The website works well enough. To perform a search, the user must enter the filter criteria in the provided input fields, highlighted below:

Unfortunately, the table will not update until the user clicks on the input field a second time. The website was, however, built for free.

## Summary
 
I will at some point figure out how to make the filtering process a bit more responsive. Ideally it would update when the user hits 'enter' or clicks out of the input field. I would also like to implement a blurb that displays what filters are currently applied to the data, and also a button to reset all filters. It would also be cool to let the user download the data, filtered or unfiltered.
